The ZiJin User Management Service Web Application Deployment, an implementation of the UMS API.

This is an implementation of  [UMS-API](https://www.cachetian.com/other/code/ums/javadoc/ "UMS-API javadoc"). also it's a non-production artifact which is initiated by me.

Due to limit knowledge at that time, only WAR version is made. otherwise the large libs will be copied too many times, however the core code is small. so WAR file is the best deliverable format, and the source code could be viewed via decompiler tools easily.

Now we have maven, for sure the artifact could be refactored to maven project, which use maven manage dependency.

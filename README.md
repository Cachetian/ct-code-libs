Why tools?

It's tools that make our life simple. especially coder, tools sometimes is the key.

Basically I want to make a model, that tool is like a product, the model is like a factory, model makes tool just as factory produce product. We can contribute our idea packed into tool as an unit to an unified repo without thinking how we organize it, it will automatically found its position in the repo, and ready to serve you as your tool.

The model is about how we make tool, and how we manage the tool, in a perfect life-cycle.

What is tools?

Ideally speaking, it's an sharp sword that can cut things. In fact so far, it's code that can make something more efficient.
